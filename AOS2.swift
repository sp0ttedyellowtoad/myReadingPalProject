Y’know  people say Harry Potter is about a mentally ill child that makes this world up because of the abuse he suffers? The ending gives that feeling - someone being stuck in this really bad situation making up the ending that they wished they had. The ending was almost unsatisfying. I wish we could have stuck around a little longer to see the aftermath. Was there national attention about this event? What was the senticing for everyone involved? How did the prisions not overflow after this? I had some many questions about the world we are leaving behind.").padding([.leading, .trailing], 105.0).padding(.bottom,15)

It was not until Chi mentioned her father’s family hating her and her mother because they were black that I realized her father was white. This only made me resent her father because he is still in contact with his racist family. WHICH MAKES ME THINK WHY IS CHI OKAY WITH THIS?? She never mentions having a problem with her father being in contact with them (except a blurb from when she was younger i think), so I am not sure 1. why she was mixed? 2. why he had to have a disapproving family. Chiamaka being mixed was added like a cute little fun fact. It saddens me to see a mixed protagonist thrown into the story when we had the opportunity for two fully black main characters. Media companies have had a long history of throwing in light-skinned mixed people for the purpose of filling the quota for black characters. Which is why I find it disappointing that when presented with the opportunity to be the showrunner - a black person would choose to randomly throw in a mixed protagonist.").padding([.leading, .trailing], 105.0).padding(.bottom,15)
             
        Text("note: I would also like to note that the children don’t treat her any better than Devon because she is half-white. She mentioned that she is treated better when her hair is straight (otherwise she is treated like an animal at the zoo). However, this commentary about forced assimilation could have been introduced by having the main character have a perm or getting weekly silk presses by her mom! My point still stands Chiamaka did not have to be mixed race. It adds a forgettable element to the story that is, at best, half baked.
